# Second Life

Second Life is a minimalistic second hand online shop (like ebay, marketplace, vinted etc.).
It is written in React Native, and focuses on the Android platform. The backend (REST api) runs on a self-hosted NextJS server.

For easy development, this project was developped with Expo ([Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/)) and makes use of [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
